# jupytercloud-project / jupyterhub_provisioner

The purpose of this repository is to provide the necessary Ansible code to provision a [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) server.
It can be used either with an Packer constructor to generate OpenStack images for example or a Terraform one to troubleshoot on a live system.

Go to the [jupyterhub_image](https://github.com/jupytercloud-project/jupyterhub_image) repository to see how to use it.
